# Slideshow
This project was done to learn and practice working with HTML Canvas. It uses a slideshow to give the viewer a sense of what the 
Kamloops Wildlife park has offer. 

### Core Technical Concepts
The slideshow itself integrates several different options to view the photos. This demonstrates what can be done
with HTML canvas and gives the viewer an opportunity to experience the tour as they prefer.
